👋 Hi, I’m Piyush

I’m a software engineer who enjoys building well-structured, scalable applications and understanding how systems work end to end. I primarily work with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, but I’m equally comfortable diving into backend services, databases, and cloud infrastructure when the problem demands it.

My work spans full-stack engineering, API design, AI-assisted features, and cloud deployment. I’ve built data-driven dashboards, AI-powered recommendation tools, CV parsing and search systems, and production-grade web applications with a strong focus on maintainability, performance, and clean architecture.

This GitHub is where I experiment, learn, and refine—whether that’s exploring modern frontend patterns, improving CI/CD workflows, integrating cloud services, or building small tools that solve real problems.
