## Hi there. I'm Piyush ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a final-year BSc (Hons) Computer Science student at Lancaster University with hands-on experience in front-end development (React, Next.js, React Native) and a growing interest in DevOps and AWS cloud deployment statergies. I love exploring new technologies, building user-friendly and scalable applications, and solving tricky coding puzzles. When Iâ€™m not developing, I enjoy diving into documentation or experimenting with open-source software.

ðŸ”­ Currently working on personal scripts, small tools, and Next.js apps.  
ðŸŒ± Learning more about AWS services, full-stack development, and advanced DevOps while refining my front-end skills and exploring automated testing (Jest).  
âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m always up for a good puzzleâ€”technical or otherwise!

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on fun projects!
